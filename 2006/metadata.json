{"CVE-2006-3392":{"Published":"2006-07-06T20:05:00","summary":"Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, as demonstrated using \"..%01\" sequences, which bypass the removal of \"../\" sequences before bytes such as \"%01\" are removed from the filename.  NOTE: This is a different issue than CVE-2006-3274."}}
