The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE."},"CVE-2002-2420":{"Published":"2002-12-31T05:00:00","summary":"site_searcher.cgi in Super Site Searcher allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the page parameter."}}
